    "This notebook takes the [Bitcoin Developers Reference](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference), specifically the [Bitcoin API](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#bitcoin-core-apis), and demonstrates the use of the Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) via python.  We employ the [regression testing mode](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-examples#regtest-mode) of bitcoin, regtest, to start with a clean blockchain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook orders the RPC methods to illustrate how to use the API.  In the [Bitcoin Developers Reference](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference) the RPC methods are in alphabetical order while the python example code below is in *discovery* sequence, starting with creating the genesis block, mining our first bitcoins, sending some to another user and showing updates to the blockchain throughout the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook may be useful for beginners looking for a simple python interface to the Bitcoin API; we use the [python bitcoin module](https://github.com/petertodd/python-bitcoinlib) created by Peter Todd for its simplicity.  As well, the value to the user who is new to python is a simple step by step walk thru of the various methods in the API in an incremental introduction without the confusion of thousands of transactions in a typical block on mainnet."

    "* [AddMultiSigAddress](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#AddMultiSigAddress): adds a P2SH multisig address to the wallet.\n",
    "* [BackupWallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#BackupWallet): safely copies wallet.dat to the specified file, which can be a directory or a path with filename.\n",
    "* [DumpPrivKey](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#DumpPrivKey): returns the wallet-import-format (WIP) private key corresponding to an address. (But does not remove it from the wallet.)\n",
    "* [DumpWallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#DumpWallet): creates or overwrites a file with all wallet keys in a human-readable format.\n",
    "* [EncryptWallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#EncryptWallet): encrypts the wallet with a passphrase. This is only to enable encryption for the first time. After encryption is enabled, you will need to enter the passphrase to use private keys.\n",
    "* [GetAccountAddress](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#GetAccountAddress): returns the current Bitcoin address for receiving payments to this account. If the account doesnâ€™t exist, it creates both the account and a new address for receiving payment. Once a payment has been received to an address, future calls to this RPC for the same account will return a different address.\n",
    "* [GetAccount](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#GetAccount): returns the name of the account associated with the given address.\n",
    "* [GetAddressesByAccount](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#GetAddressesByAccount): returns a list of every address assigned to a particular account.\n",
    "* [GetBalance](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#GetBalance): gets the balance in decimal bitcoins across all accounts or for a particular account.\n",
    "* [GetNewAddress](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#GetNewAddress): returns a new Bitcoin address for receiving payments. If an account is specified, payments received with the address will be credited to that account.\n",
    "* [GetRawChangeAddress](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#GetRawChangeAddress): returns a new Bitcoin address for receiving change. This is for use with raw transactions, not normal use.\n",
    "* [GetReceivedByAccount](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#GetReceivedByAccount): returns the total amount received by addresses in a particular account from transactions with the specified number of confirmations. It does not count coinbase transactions.\n",
    "* [GetReceivedByAddress](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#GetReceivedByAddress): returns the total amount received by the specified address in transactions with the specified number of confirmations. It does not count coinbase transactions.\n",
    "* [GetTransaction](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#GetTransaction): gets detailed information about an in-wallet transaction. Updated in 0.10.0\n",
    "* [GetUnconfirmedBalance](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#GetUnconfirmedBalance): returns the walletâ€™s total unconfirmed balance.\n",
    "* [GetWalletInfo](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#GetWalletInfo): provides information about the wallet. New in 0.9.2\n",
    "* [ImportAddress](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#ImportAddress): adds an address or pubkey script to the wallet without the associated private key, allowing you to watch for transactions affecting that address or pubkey script without being able to spend any of its outputs. New in 0.10.0\n",
    "* [ImportPrivKey](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#ImportPrivKey): adds a private key to your wallet. The key should be formatted in the wallet import format created by the dumpprivkey RPC.\n",
    "* [ImportWallet](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#ImportWallet): imports private keys from a file in wallet dump file format (see the dumpwallet RPC). These keys will be added to the keys currently in the wallet. This call may need to rescan all or parts of the block chain for transactions affecting the newly-added keys, which may take several minutes.\n",
    "* [KeyPoolRefill](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#KeyPoolRefill): fills the cache of unused pre-generated keys (the keypool).\n",
    "* [ListAccounts](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#ListAccounts): lists accounts and their balances. Updated in 0.10.0\n",
    "* [ListAddressGroupings](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#ListAddressGroupings): lists groups of addresses that may have had their common ownership made public by common use as inputs in the same transaction or from being used as change from a previous transaction.\n",
    "* [ListLockUnspent](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#ListLockUnspent): returns a list of temporarily unspendable (locked) outputs.\n",
    "* [ListReceivedByAccount](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#ListReceivedByAccount): lists the total number of bitcoins received by each account. Updated in 0.10.0\n",

    "* [ListTransactions](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#ListTransactions): returns the most recent transactions that affect the wallet. Updated in 0.10.0\n",
    "* [ListUnspent](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#ListUnspent): returns an array of unspent transaction outputs belonging to this wallet. Updated in 0.10.0\n",
    "* [LockUnspent](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#LockUnspent): temporarily locks or unlocks specified transaction outputs. A locked transaction output will not be chosen by automatic coin selection when spending bitcoins. Locks are stored in memory only, so nodes start with zero locked outputs and the locked output list is always cleared when a node stops or fails.\n",
    "* [Move](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#Move): moves a specified amount from one account in your wallet to another using an off-block-chain transaction.\n",
    "* [SendFrom](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#SendFrom): spends an amount from a local account to a bitcoin address.\n",

    "* [SetTxFee](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#SetTxFee): sets the transaction fee per kilobyte paid by transactions created by this wallet.\n",
    "* [SignMessage](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#SignMessage): signs a message with the private key of an address.\n",
    "* [WalletLock](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#WalletLock): removes the wallet encryption key from memory, locking the wallet. After calling this method, you will need to call walletpassphrase again before being able to call any methods which require the wallet to be unlocked.\n",
    "* [WalletPassphrase](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#WalletPassphrase): stores the wallet decryption key in memory for the indicated number of seconds. Issuing the walletpassphrase command while the wallet is already unlocked will set a new unlock time that overrides the old one.\n",
    "* [WalletPassphraseChange](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#walletpassphrasechange): changes the wallet passphrase from â€˜old passphraseâ€™ to â€˜new passphraseâ€™.\n",
